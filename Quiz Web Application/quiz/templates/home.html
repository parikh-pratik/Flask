      Welcome to Quizzr. Let me start by apologising for the weird name. Quizzr is a quiz application. There are total 16 categories and the the total number of questions available are 800, 50 per category. The gameplay is quite simple. You need to <a href="{{ url_for('login') }}">Login</a>; then go to <a href="{{ url_for('playquiz') }}"> Play Quiz</a>, select your desired category and the number of questions and there you go! To select or deselect an option, simply click it. Once done, click submit to get your score. You can also check your score in the <a href="{{ url_for('leaderboard') }}">Leaderboard</a> section. If you just want to see your scores, go to the <a href="{{ url_for('account') }}">Account</a> section. You can even view your acount details there. Without creating an account, you can't play but don't worry, I have created a dummy accounts with <code class="dark"> Username: test1</code> and <code class="dark"> Password: test</code>, <code class="dark"> Username: test2</code> and <code class="dark"> Password: test</code>, <code class="dark"> Username: test3</code>, and <code class="dark"> Password: test</code> and so on upto <code class="dark"> Username: test10</code> and <code class="dark"> Password: test</code> for you to play with. But at a time only one person can play the quiz with this account and even your scores won't have any name. To overcome these limitations, you'll need to create an account. Don't worry, I won't be spamming your emails, they're totally safe. If you want, you can even specify dummy email ids like abc@xyz.com, for example. I hope you like the website. Please give your valuable feedback, comments, suggestions in the <a href="{{ url_for('comments') }}">Comments</a> section. You can also comment on the LinkedIn post.

      This website was made using Python Flask as Backend with SQLAlchemy and MySQL as the database. Although I hate designing the Frontend, I employed Javascript, jQuery and AJAX along with the usual HTML and CSS. FlaskWTF was used for all the forms and login_manager for handling User Authentication and Authorization. This whole project took me about 25 days to make. The questions have been taken from <a href="https://opentdb.com/">Open Trivia Database</a>, a wonderful site for questions and answers.

      I am Pratik Parikh, a final year student of Computer Engineering awaiting my exams and results. I am a Learner. During the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown, I decided to learn Flask since is appeals to my inner Python enthusiasm. Previously I had made a URL Shortening Service website with Flask and now this Quiz Website. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/pratik198">GitHub</a> page and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parikh-pratik">LinkedIn</a> page to find out more...
